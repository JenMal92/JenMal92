### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jen, a data science enthusiast and a healthcare professional. I have a masterâ€™s degree in occupational therapy and I have worked in various healthcare settings. Through my experience, I realised the importance and potential of data in enhancing healthcare outcomes and quality. Thatâ€™s why I decided to enrol in a data science bootcamp with Hyperion Dev, where Iâ€™m learning how to analyse, visualise, and model data using Python, SQL, Excel, and other tools. Iâ€™m excited to apply my data skills to solve real-world problems and create positive impact. On my GitHub profile, you can find some of the projects that I have worked on during the bootcamp and beyond. Feel free to check them out and connect with me.
